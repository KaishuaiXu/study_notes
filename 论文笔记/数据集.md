  > The queries in this dataset were sampled between 1 March, 2006 and 31 May, 2006. In total there are 16,946,938 queries submitted by 657,426 unique users.

  > 一般对该数据集的处理方法：
  >
  > We removed all non-alphanumeric characters from the queries, applied word segmentation and lowercasing. We deﬁne a session by a 30-minute window of inactive time, and ﬁltered sessions by their lengths (minimum 2, maximum 10). We only kept the most frequent |V | = 100k words and mapped all other words to an <unk> token when constructing the vocabulary. We randomly selected 1,032,459 sessions for training, 129,053 sessions for development and 91,108 sessions for testing, with no overlapping.
